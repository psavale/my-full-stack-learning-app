- What is JavaScript ??
  - JavaScript is a versatile, high-level programming language designed to make web pages interactive. It has grown beyond its initial use case in browsers and is now used for server-side applications, mobile app development, desktop applications, and more. JavaScript’s flexibility and the massive ecosystem of libraries and frameworks make it one of the most popular programming languages in the world.

Features of Javascript

- Client-Side Language
- Object-Oriented
- Event-Driven
- Cross-Platform
- make api call using Ajax and fetch api  ( Api calls can also be made using library called Axios )

Where it is used ?

- Web application development
- Mobile App Development
- JavaScript frameworks like React Native or Ionic are used to develop cross-platform mobile apps
- Server-Side Scripting
- Node.js allows JavaScript to be used for creating scalable server-side applications.

Concepts in JavaScript

Inheritance -

- JavaScript inheritance is the method through which the objects inherit the properties and the methods from the other objects. It enables code reuse and structuring of relationships between objects, creating a hierarchy where a child object can access features of its parent object. Inheritance in JavaScript can be achieved in the following ways:
       JavaScript inheritance is the method through which the objects inherit the properties and the methods from the other objects.
- Super keyword is used in classes to call the properties and methods of the parent class.

Method overloading
Method overrriding
Data types

- Primitive data types
- Non-primitive types

Is array a Data Type or Data Structure?

- Array is a data structure because it defines how data is stored and accessed (in a linear, indexed way).

- new versions of ECMAScript introduce new features and syntax enhancements
- ES5
- ES6
  - let, const, arrow functions, classes, template literals, promises, and modules features introduced
- ES7, ES8
  - async/await, object spread/rest operators, etc. features got introduced
- ES14 ( latest version of ECMAScript)
  - findLast,  findLastIndex, toReversed, toSorted, toSpliced, with

What is TypeScript ??

- TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and other advanced features to the language, allowing developers to write safer and more maintainable code. It was developed and is maintained by Microsoft. TypeScript compiles down to plain JavaScript, meaning that it can run in any environment where JavaScript runs, including browsers, Node.js, and mobile apps.

### What is NodeJS ??? ####

- Node.js is a runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser, typically on a server. It uses the V8 JavaScript engine (the same engine used by Google Chrome) to execute code, enabling JavaScript to be used for server-side scripting and building scalable, high-performance applications.
Key Characteristics of Node.js:
- Event-Driven Architecture
- Non-Blocking (Asynchronous) I/O
OOPS concepts
 Dynamic Array

Database types  

- Relation database
  - MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server
  - Ideal for applications where data consistency and complex queries (joins) are essential.
  - used for sturctured data
   — Strong schema enforcement
  - ACID compliance (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)

- NoSQL Databases
  - These databases are designed for unstructured, semi-structured, or highly scalable data storage, often without fixed schemas.
        1. Document Stores: Store data as documents (often JSON or BSON).  MongoDB, CouchDB
        2. Key-Value Stores: Store data as key-value pairs. ( Redis, Amazon DynamoDB )
        3. Column Family Stores: Store data in columns rather than rows (good for large datasets)  ( Apache Cassandra, HBase)
        4. Graph Databases: Focus on storing relationships between entities in the form of nodes and edges. ( Neo4j, ArangoDB)
 Use Cases: Real-time web applications, large-scale distributed systems, content management, IoT, and big data.

- NewSQL Databases
  - Use Cases: Applications requiring the scale of NoSQL but with strong consistency, such as large e-commerce sites, and financial systems ( Google Spanner )
- In-Memory Databases ( Redis, Memcached )
- Graph database  
- Time series database ( Prometheus )
  - Use Cases: IoT, financial data, server monitoring, sensor data, and event logs.
