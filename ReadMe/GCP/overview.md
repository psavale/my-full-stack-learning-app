# GCP features

```markdown
1. Workload Identity: - In Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is a method of securely granting identities (like Kubernetes Pods, VMs, or other resources) access to GCP services without needing to manage and expose long-lived credentials like service account keys. 

Benefits of Workload Identity
No Long-Lived Keys: Reduces the security risks associated with managing service account keys.
Short-Lived Credentials: Provides temporary tokens with limited lifetimes.
Seamless Integration: Works naturally with Kubernetes, Compute Engine, and other GCP services.
