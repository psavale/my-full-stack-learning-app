# type script basics

- TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript developed and maintained by Microsoft. It builds on JavaScript by adding optional static typing and interfaces, enabling developers to catch errors at compile time instead of runtime. This makes TypeScript particularly beneficial for large, complex codebases and collaborative projects.
  - Static Typing
  - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Support - it supports features like classes, inheritance, interfaces,enum and access modifiers
  - Interfaces and Type Aliases
  - Compile-Time Error Checking - this benefits in Improved Code Quality
